I'm a curious seeker with a zest for exploring new fields to expand my horizons. I'm currently completing my university degree in Computer Science Engineering (CSE), but my learning journey extends beyond the classroom.

## 👨‍💻 My Technical Expertise

I'm primarily focused on mastering programming languages like **C** and **C++**, with a particular interest in **game development**. I'm also proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm actively expanding my skillset in **algorithms and data structures**.

Though I'm still learning, I'm enthusiastic about applying my skills to meaningful projects. I'm not yet ready to create AAA games or mind-blowing websites, but I'm committed to continuous learning and improvement.

## 🍱 My Diverse Interests

Beyond technology, I'm fascinated by a variety of fields, including open-source projects, content writing, inbound marketing, computer hardware, animation, video editing, and leadership practices. 

This diverse range of interests reflects my curiosity and willingness to explore new avenues of learning and growth.

## 🤝 Collaboration and Future Plans

I'm always open to collaboration opportunities, and constantly seeking new challenges and learning experiences. While I'm not currently involved in any specific collaborations, 

I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology and creative endeavors.
